# About

Get busy living or get busy dying. 

Yes, I am still investing effort to catch up with new technologies. My IT career started from database and passed advanced DB2 adminstrator certificate. Refreshed Linux knowledge and passed SUSE Adminstrator in 2019. Now I am interested in Kubernetes and passed CKA certificate, which is the entry level to step into the new technology. Open source world is so interesting, too many things for the eye to see......

What's past is prologue. Itâ€™s never too late to do.
