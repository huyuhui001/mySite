Get busy living or get busy dying. 

Yes, I am still investing effort to catch up with new technologies. Refreshed Linux knowledge and passed SUSE Adminstrator in 2019. Learnd and passed CKA certificate in 2022, which is the entry level to step into the new technology. In open source world, too many things for the eye to see......

What's past is prologue. Itâ€™s never too late to do.
