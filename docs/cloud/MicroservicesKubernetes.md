# Hands-On Microservices with Kubernetes

## Chapter 1 - Kubernetes

Introduction to Kubernetes for Developers, introduces you to Kubernetes. You will receive a whirlwind tour of Kubernetes and get an ideaof how well it aligns with microservices.

## Chapter 2 - Microservices

Getting Started with Microservices, discusses various aspects,patterns, and approaches to common problems in microservice-basedsystems and how they compare to other common architectures, such asmonoliths and large services.

## Chapter 3 - Sample Application

Delinkcious – the Sample Application, explores why we should choose Go as the programming language of Delinkcious; then we will lookat Go kit.

## Chapter 4 - CI/CD Pipeline

Setting Up the CI/CD Pipeline, teaches you about the problem the CI/CD pipeline solves, covers the different options for CI/CD pipelinesfor Kubernetes, and finally looks at building a CI/CD pipeline forDelinkcious.

## Chapter 5 - Configuring Microservices

Configuring Microservices with Kubernetes, moves you into the practical and real-world area of microservices configuration. Also, we will discuss Kubernetes-specific options and, in particular, ConfigMaps.

## Chapter 6 - Securing Microservices

Securing Microservices on Kubernetes, examines how to secure your microservices on Kubernetes in depth. We will also discuss the pillars that act as the foundation of microservice security on Kubernetes.

## Chapter 7 - APIs and Load Balancers

Talking to the World – APIs and Load Balancers, sees us open Delinkcious to the world and let users interact with it from outside the cluster. Also, we will add a gRPC-based news service that users can hitup to get news about other users they follow. Finally, we will add a message queue that lets services communicate in a loosely coupled manner.

## Chapter 8 - Stateful Services

Working with Stateful Services, delves into the Kubernetesstorage model. We will also extend the Delinkcious news service to store itsdata in Redis, instead of in memory.

## Chapter 9 Serverless Tasks

Running Serverless Tasks on Kubernetes, dives into one of thehottest trends in cloud-native systems: serverless computing (also knownas Function as a Service, or FaaS). Also, we'll cover other ways to doserverless computing in Kubernetes.

## Chapter 10 - Testing Microservices

Testing Microservices, covers the topic of testing and its variousflavors: unit testing, integration testing, and all kinds of end-to-end testing.We also delve into how Delinkcious tests are structured.

## Chapter 11 - Deploying Microservices

Deploying Microservices, deals with two related, yet separate,themes: production deployments and development deployments. 

## Chapter 12 - Operationing Microservices

Monitoring, Logging, and Metrics, focuses on the operational side of running a large-scale distributed system on Kubernetes, as well ason how to design the system and what to take into account to ensure atop-notch operational posture. 

## Chapter 13 - Service Mesh 

Service Mesh – Working with Istio, reviews the hot topic ofservice meshes and, in particular, Istio. This is exciting because service meshes are a real game changer.

## Chapter 14 - The Future

The Future of Microservices and Kubernetes, covers the topicsof Kubernetes and microservices, and will help us learn how to decide whenit's the right time to adopt and invest in newer technologies.
